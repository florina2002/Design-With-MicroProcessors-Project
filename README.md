# Design-With-MicroProcessors-Project
This project involves creating a simple piano using an Arduino Uno, a breadboard, six buttons (acting as piano keys), an ultrasonic sensor, an RGB LED, and a buzzer. The piano plays different musical notes based on the buttons pressed and adjusts the color of the RGB LED based on the distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor.
